# Framework Rules

## Framework Location
- Framework JAR: `lib/Framework.jar`

## Framework Usage Rules
1. All new code must use the framework classes and methods from `lib/Framework.jar`
2. Do not create new classes that duplicate framework functionality
3. Follow the framework's design patterns and conventions
4. Use framework's built-in utilities instead of creating custom solutions
5. Maintain consistency with existing framework usage in the codebase

## Framework Dependencies
- All projects must include `lib/Framework.jar` in their classpath
- Framework version must be specified in project configuration files

## Code Style
- Follow framework's naming conventions
- Use framework's logging system
- Implement framework interfaces when required
- Use framework's configuration system

## Best Practices
- Document framework usage in code comments
- Keep framework dependencies up to date
- Report framework issues through proper channels
- Test code against framework requirements
